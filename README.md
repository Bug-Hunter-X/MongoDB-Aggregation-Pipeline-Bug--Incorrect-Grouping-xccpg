The provided `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to group documents but produces inaccurate results due to a flaw in the grouping logic. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the aggregation pipeline.

## Bug Description
The `$group` stage in the aggregation pipeline is not correctly grouping the documents, leading to inaccurate counts. This could be due to issues in the `_id` field specification or other issues within the pipeline stages. 

## Solution
